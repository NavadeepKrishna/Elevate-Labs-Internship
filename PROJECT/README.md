### HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Prediction Using Machine Learning



This project applies HR analytics and machine learning to analyze the reasons behind employee resignation and predict future attrition. It helps HR teams take proactive decisions to reduce employee turnover and improve workforce stability.



#### Project Overview:



Attrition causes loss of talent, increased training cost, and reduced productivity. This project uses data analytics, explainable ML, and visualization to:



* Identify why employees leave



* Predict who is likely to leave



* Provide retention strategies based on data
