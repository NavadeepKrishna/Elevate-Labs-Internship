### Titanic Dataset EDA 



This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the Titanic dataset as part of the Data Analyst Internship Task assigned by Elevate Labs.



The objective is to extract insights through statistical and visual exploration of the dataset.

#### ðŸ§  Key Insights



Females had higher survival rates than males.



First-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to lower classes.



Higher fares correspond to better survival chances.



Younger passengers (children) had better survival probability.



Cabin data had high missing values and was labeled as 'Unknown'.
