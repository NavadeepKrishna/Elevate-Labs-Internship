## Task 2: Hostel Snacks Demand Dashboard Report

* This document serves as the professional report for the Hostel Snacks Demand Analysis project. The accompanying dashboard visualizes the canteen's sales data to provide clear, actionable insights into student snack consumption patterns.



### Project Goal

The primary objective of this analysis was to transform the raw sales data from the Hostel\_snacks\_demand.csv file into a strategic tool. 

The insights derived from the dashboard allow hostel management to:

* Optimize Inventory: Efficiently stock the most demanded snack types.
* Maximize Revenue: Understand and capitalize on peak sales periods.
* Improve Operations: Allocate staff and resources effectively based on time-of-day and day-of-week demand.



### Dashboard Key Findings

The dashboard clearly segments total snack demand across different dimensions, providing a granular view of customer behavior.



##### 1\. Popularity and Inventory Insights

* The data analysis reveals which snack types are the primary drivers of sales volume:



* The dashboard's Snack Type Breakdown chart identifies the Top Selling Snack Categories (e.g., Chips, Chocolates, or Biscuits).



* Understanding these top categories is crucial for optimizing the supply chain to prevent stock-outs during busy times.



##### 2\. Time-Based Demand Trends

* The analysis of demand over time highlights predictable consumption cycles:



* Peak Demand Days: Sales volume is significantly higher on certain days of the week, often including weekends (Saturday and Sunday) and potentially the start of the week (Monday).



* Low Demand Days: Conversely, the mid-week period (Tuesday to Thursday) typically shows a dip in sales, suggesting an opportunity for targeted promotions.



* Time of Day: If time-of-day data is visualized, the dashboard likely shows demand peaking in the evening hours (e.g., 7 PM to 10 PM) for study breaks and relaxation.
